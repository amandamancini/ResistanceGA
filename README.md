ResistanceGA
============

### An R package to optimize resistance surfaces using Genetic Algorithms. Both continuous and categorical surfaces can be optimized using these functions. Additionally, it is possible to simultaneously optimize multiple resistance surfaces at the same time to generate novel resistance surfaces. Resistance distances can be calculated as cost distances (least cost path) between points, or as circuit-based resistance distances calculated using CIRCUITSCAPE    

To install this package, execute the following commands in R:

```
# Install 'devtools' package, if needed
if(!("devtools" %in% list.files(.libPaths()))) {
    install.packages("devtools", repo = "http://cran.rstudio.com", dep = TRUE) 
} 

devtools::install_github("wpeterman/ResistanceGA", build_vignettes = TRUE) # Download package

library(ResistanceGA) # Installs package and the other required packages needed
```
Once the package is installed, you can further explore the functions by opening the 'Vignette' using the code below, or you can view the vignette directly [**here**](http://petermanresearch.weebly.com/uploads/2/5/9/2/25926970/resistancega.pdf "Vignette")
```
vignette('ResistanceGA')  # Opens PDF
```

### Other notes

If you wish to optimize using CIRCUITSCAPE, you must have CIRCUITSCAPE installed.
Version 4.0 or higher is required.
Official CIRCUITSCAPE releases can be found [**here**](https://code.google.com/p/circuitscape/downloads/list "CS downloads")


Using `ResistanceGA` to optimize with CIRCUITSCAPE has been most thoroughly tested on **_Windows_** machines. To run CIRCUITSCAPE on Linux (tested with Ubuntu 16.04):    
1.  Install CIRCUITSCAPE---Default installation directory is `/usr/local/bin/csrun.py`   
2. To call CIRCUITSCAPE from R, change file permissions using ` sudo chomod 755 /usr/local/bin/csrun.py `  
    * This will allow `csrun.py` to be executed without specifying paths.

This approach has been developed from the methods first utilized in Peterman et al. (2014). I have also written a preprint manuscript further describing this `R` package. **_Please cite these papers if you use these methods!_**
